# code-quiz
A quiz to test coding knowledge.
A simple quiz posing five questions about Javascript for users to answer. Once the start button is pressed the quiz will cycle through five questions (displaying the answers in random order) until either all questions are asked or the time runs out. The user will be able to enter their initials and save their score, and then return to the start page. In the top left of the screen there is a button that will lead to the high scores page, displaying the scores of all who have played on that browser.
