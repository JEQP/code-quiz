                This quiz will test your knowledge on coding to an extent to which you have never before been subject!
                Unless,
                maybe, you've previously done a quiz on coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The format is simple. A question will appear on the screen, and you will be offered four different
                options, only <em>one</em> of which is correct. Choose wisely, for while a correct answer will raise
                your score, an erroenous response will REMOVE 15 SECONDS FROM YOUR AVAILABLE TIME!
            </p>

                I'll leave it up to you to decide if that was a good score, relative to where you are in the learning process. If you want to compare scores with anyone else who has done the test on this computer, please fill in the form below.
