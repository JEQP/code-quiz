                This quiz will test your knowledge on coding to an extent to which you have never before been subject!
                Unless,
                maybe, you've previously done a quiz on coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The format is simple. A question will appear on the screen, and you will be offered four different
                options, only <em>one</em> of which is correct. Choose wisely, for while a correct answer will raise
                your score, an erroenous response will REMOVE 15 SECONDS FROM YOUR AVAILABLE TIME!
